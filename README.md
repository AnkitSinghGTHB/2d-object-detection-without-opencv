# 2d-object-detection-without-opencv
Segments objects in an image by grouping connected pixels with similar RGB values using a flood-fill algorithm. It filters small objects, identifies the largest as the background, and assigns unique IDs. The results are visualized by overlaying object IDs on an output image, skipping the background.
